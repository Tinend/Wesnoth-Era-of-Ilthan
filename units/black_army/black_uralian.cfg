    description= _ "Uralians are known across the island for their strength and honorable nature, usually siding with the righteous forces of Artonians or the Lizard Alliance. However, some have succumbed to the Black Armyâ€™s influence, donning dark armor and fighting with grim determination. These Black Uralians are a rare and ominous sight, wielding heavy weapons and forsaking their former alliances for the call of darkness."

    description=_"This fiercely aggressive juvenile creature prowls the caves, driven by an insatiable appetite for battle. Drawn to the faintest sounds, it often recklessly attacks anything that moves. The earthmen, understanding the Garavandionâ€™s fearlessness, lure these creatures with small prey and trap them using nets and pits. Though wild, a captured Young Garavandion becomes an unpredictable yet invaluable asset in battle."

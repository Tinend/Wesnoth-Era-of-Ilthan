    description=_"Though the purpose behind much of the earthmenâ€™s labor may appear unclear, occasionally their efforts result in remarkable structures or traps. The Overman, a step above the common worker, is responsible for organizing these rare successes. With a keen eye for strategy, Overmen coordinate their fellow workers, transforming their aimless energy into directed action. Though still modest in combat, they hold authority among the earthmen and can rally a small group for defense."

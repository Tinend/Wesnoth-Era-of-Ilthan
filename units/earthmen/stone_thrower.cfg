    description=_"Many earthmen are seen carrying stones wherever they go, though the reason remains a mystery. These stones, however, become unexpectedly useful in combat, as the earthmen are quick to hurl them at intruders. Though untrained and unrefined, a volley of stones from a group of these Stone Throwers can cause surprising damage, making them a valuable part of the earthmenâ€™s defenses."

    description= _ "If someone who isn't able to learn how to use magic is very effective in a battle, he has the change to become noble and then, he has even the chance to be accepted as a human being and to lead a normal live as a mountain non-mage. However, to be noble is not as good as it sounds. In most peoples, the noble have privileges the normal people don't have, here it is just a sign, what a high award this is, but they are in no way placed above common mages."

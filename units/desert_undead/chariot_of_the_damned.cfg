    description= _ "The Chariot of the Damned is the final evolution of chariot warfare, crafted for the desertâ€™s most fearsome warriors and driven by the darkest magic. These chariots, now reinforced with bone and iron, tear across the battlefield with terrifying speed, leaving only destruction in their wake. Its spiked wheels and cursed frame are designed to crush even the sturdiest defenses, while its rider strikes with relentless fury. Propelled by the wrath of ancient kings, the Chariot of the Damned is an unstoppable force, feared by all who see its shadow upon the sand."

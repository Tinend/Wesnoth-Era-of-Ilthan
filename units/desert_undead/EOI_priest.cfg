    description= _ "The priests were part of the government in the ancient culture, wich lived in the desert many thousand years ago. They had to take care, that the will of the Pharao was respected in every town. So they had a lot of power. However, they also had to take care of people who didn't follow the pharaos will. This is why only people, where you know, that they won't have any problems with a village turning against them. They also had the ability to heal when they were alive, but this is not working any more now. But it is their only ability wich is not working any more."

    description= _ "Unable to master horseback combat fully, the ancient desert people instead perfected the use of chariots in battle. These skeletal charioteers retain memories of their past tactics, using their chariots to strike with surprising speed across the sands. Though slower than mounted cavalry, they bring a formidable force to flat terrains, where they can barrel into enemy lines and scatter them. In death, the chariotâ€™s wheels grind through sand and bone alike, leaving a path of destruction behind."

    description= _ "When the necromancers want to control for a short time an empty part of a river they use water corpse. But when they really nead corpses to fight in water they use sea corpses. These corpses are feared as they are fast in water and won´t be stopped easily. Often if sea corpses appear there is a real army needed to stop them, as only experienced sorcerers are able to controle sea corpses."

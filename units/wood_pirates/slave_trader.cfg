    description= _ "One of the major business of the wood pirates is to catch and sell slaves. This is a very cruel story, because they either keep the slaves for their own purpose and they are known to treat their slaves very badly or they sell them to another country far away from home. Every village has a few slave traders which are responsible for sorting out worthless slaves and deciding which ones to keep for which works and which ones to sell for which price and for selling them in the end. The sad thing about wood pirates is, that trading slaves is maybe one of their most honourable businesses, because it is one of the few things they do that does not involve killing people."

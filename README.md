Wesnoth offers a flexible environment for creating custom content such as campaigns, units, and eras, allowing players to build and share their own scenarios and factions.

## About the Era

This era takes place on an island far from the Wesnoth mainland, where the human nation of Artonia defends itself against the **Black Army**, **Wood Pirates**, and the powerful **Desert Undead**. The Artonians are aided by their unreliable allies, the **Mountain Mages**, who live in the high mountains across a dangerous forest. Meanwhile, the lizard alliance, consisting of dragons, desert lizards, and Uralians from the swamps, forms a coalition to protect their lands from various threats, including undead armies and researchers from human factions.

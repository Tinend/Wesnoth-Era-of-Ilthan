Era of Ilthan
=============

This site will be updated continuously.

History: Our era takes place on an island far away in the ocean.

Playing:


Mountain Mages
--------------
Main author: My brother

History: The mountain mages are very good friends of the Artons, because they need to trade with them because the Artons are much better at creating things then they are. They teached the Artons to use magic and help them in battle sometimes. But they also have a bad side: They are very arrogant, especially towards those among themselves which are not able to use magic and treat them extremely badly. Furthermore, they always slaughter the earthmen in a cruel way during their expeditions in the caves of their home mountains.

Playing: They have of course the best mages, but if I play them, the biggest part of my army consists of fighting mages. They are neither as strong as other melee fighters nor do they have extremely good ranged combat and their hp are mediocre, too. But the fact that they are decent at both of them makes them an extremely powerful unit.

Art TODO: Some units are terrible and have to be repainted, this has mediocre priority.

Rules TODO: Almost nothing except balancing.


Earthmen
--------
Main author: Me

History: The earthmen live in tunnels in the mountains and have a cruel war against the mountain mages. Usually, they are not evil, but since they have to defend themselves against the mountain mages every day, they are pretty critical towards strangers.

Playing: They have a lot of cost efficient lvl 0 units and some strong monsters inclusive one with berserk, but they have some problems with ranged combat.

Art TODO: The earthmen and onoloms are considered pretty finished unless we get more ambitious one day. The other monsters still have only one sprite for all levels, which is not enough.

Rules TODO: It is possible that the earthmen and/or the monsters get (different) custom traits. I want to add another monster as a special unit as soon as I get an idea and maybe, the normal monster gets a small ability just to give it an individual note. Furthermore, a lot of balancing work has to be done.


Artons
------
Main author: My brother

History: The Artons are the main "good guy" faction and consists of humans. They are defending themselves against frequent attacks by swamp undead, wood pirates and the black army. Sometimes they get help from their friends, the mountain mages and in very bad times, it occurs that even the lizard alliance helps them.

Playing: The Artons have the best archers and solid decent melee fighters, horsemen and mages. They are the most versatile faction, maybe they are slightly similar to Loyalists, but their mages and horseman aren't that awesome, therefore, their bowman are better.

Art TODO: There is obviously still much to do, especially for units > lvl 1. Most sprites are terrible and have to be repainted.

Rules TODO: They'll get a trait called "honourable" or something like that. This leads to an advantage against fully healed units. They get a different kind of swimmer than now, too.


Lizard Alliance
---------------
Main author: My brother

History: The lizards live in the desert and want to be left alone there. They have an eternal war with the Desert Undead, which live in the same desert and sometimes have to defend their coast against Wood Pirates. Usually, they don't like human beings in their desert, but in very bad times, it occurs that they help the Artons to defend against attackers. The lizards made an alliance with the highly intelligent people of the Ural swamp, which have a lot of problems with the desert undead and the dragons from the southern mountains which are quite friendly towards almost everyone except desert undead.

Disclaimer: They are NOT inspired by Saurians and Drakes. We invented the lizards first (those were inspired by another self created game) and added the dragons much later.

Playing: The AI fights worst with this faction and loses every match with it, but I think that it is great for a human. They are pretty versatile, but in general, they have very mobile hard hitting units with few hp and bad resistances and a very good blocking unit. So time of day is extremely important for them and their mobility has to be used to take advantage of this. That's my favorite faction to play with.

Art TODO: It's the first faction we made the art for and it has been redone and improved several times. Still, it has to be improved, but right now, the priority is lower than for other factions.

Rules TODO: Almost nothing except balancing.


Swamp Undead
------------
Main author: My brother

History: Once upon a time, a huge army of Artons wanted to eradicate the black army for once and for all, but they were ambushed, hunted into a swamp and killed. Now some strange people use black magic to use the bodies of that army for their evil purposes.

Playing: I personally don't like to play them very much, they are slightly similar to normal undead, but have a bigger focus on walking corpses and no skeletons. If you play them, you can feel that they are obviously not finished.

Art TODO: It's one of the two factions we're working most for, obviously, most sprites have to be repainted.

Rules TODO: We have to rethink the whole faction, since right now it seems too weak and not really playable.


Desert Undead
-------------
Main author: Me

History: A very long time ago, a powerful and highly developed people lived in the desert, now, many thousand years later, the skeletons and mummies of those people raise again and fight against the lizards, the new inhabitants of the desert for their formal home.

Playing: Their main melee unit is the strongest lvl 1 melee unit of the whole era. If you manage to advance one, chariots are also quite effective. But their best unit is probably the mummy, which has both melee and ranged attacks, which turns them into a very strong unit although both attacks are worse than that of a normal ranged/melee unit.

Art TODO: Mostly frankensteined, so it needs to be repainted, the chariots are just terrible, but I'm pretty happy with the mummies. They still need some improvements to make the different lvls more individual and I'll have to add team colors, too.

Rules TODO: They need a real scout, their rider is not really capable of doing that job. We'll maybe give them a flying unit.


Black Army
----------
Main author: Me

History: The black army lives in a long valley in the mountains of the north eastern part of the island. Once in a while, they build a big army and attack the Artons. Their goal is to kill all other factions although they sometimes work together with the Swamp Undead.

Playing: They have strong melee units, their ranged unit is also rather stronger in melee, but weaker in ranged combat than other ranged units. They're mostly neutral and most units are not very mobile. They have to make use of the ninja unit, which has poison and backstab. I'd hate to play them without the ninja, but that unit actually makes it funny to play them.

Art TODO: Everything is either frankensteined or terrible, so most units have to be repainted, some have to be improved. But this hasn't very high priority yet.

Rules TODO: Once upon a time, we wanted to give them a "black mage" unit, but probably we skip that, because they already have too many units. They need some kind of swimmer, though.


Wood Pirates
------------
Main author: My brother

History: They hide in the north western forest and are one of the most aggressive people. Those wood pirates at the coast are feared among other coast cities because of their frequent raids. Those more inside the forest are much less aggressive, because they only kill people who come into their forest, but that is rather understandable because they only defend their home.

Playing: Their pirate is a cost efficient decent melee unit which does well in shallow water, too, but I rather prefer to play the forest units, which are less cost efficient if you only look at direct combat, but you can build a whole army with the ambush rule, which is actually quite funny, especially because you can really win against computers with a lot more money. I don't know how to estimate the potential of the slave catcher, who generates gold in case of a kill.

Art TODO: It's one of the two faction we are working on right now. We finished some lvl 1 units, but the others have still the old terrible sprites.

Rules TODO: We'll maybe add a boat unit or something like that. A lot of balancing tests have to be done, since the effect of their ambush ability can't really be tested against the AI in a meaningful way.


What you can help:

It's probably still too early to ask for help, but I'll still point out what would be the best things you could help us with:
Give feedback/playtest
Help us with the descriptions, since we are both not really heroes in writing English texts.
Answer my questions :)

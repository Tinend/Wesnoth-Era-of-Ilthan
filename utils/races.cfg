    descrition=_"The earthmen are a reclusive, industrious people inhabiting the darkest and most labyrinthine caves of the underground. Physically shorter and more compact than humans, they possess tough, resilient bodies that allow them to withstand the cold, damp conditions of their subterranean homes. Earthmen are known for their quiet, almost ghostly presence, often moving in silent groups and toiling away on mysterious tasks. While their motivations are not always clear to outsiders, everything they do serves their collective survival in the harsh underground environment. The earthmen place high value on cooperation and ingenuity, with each individual filling a role, however small, to ensure the welfare of the entire community.

Their society is structured and highly organized, albeit in ways that may seem chaotic to an outsider. The earthmen’s social roles are divided mainly into workers, builders, and warriors, with a clear hierarchy that centers around a singular figure—the King. Though the King rarely speaks, his leadership is unchallenged, as he holds both wisdom and strength, often mediating disputes and directing defensive strategies. The earthmen have a natural affinity for constructing traps, barricades, and other functional structures, using basic tools and materials found in their environment. Even their simple weapons, like stones and slings, are crafted with care to suit their compact, precise fighting style. In times of conflict, earthmen warriors are trained to defend their homes, though their preference is always to avoid aggression unless absolutely necessary.

Despite their physical limitations, the earthmen have learned to work alongside the natural creatures of the caves, which they capture and tame to supplement their defenses. These captured monsters, carefully selected for their unique traits, become valuable assets in the earthmen’s strategy of survival. While their interactions with the outside world are rare, the earthmen have developed sophisticated tactics to defend against any intruders who might disturb their sanctuary. As a race, they are resourceful, cautious, and determined to protect the peace of their underground realm, knowing well the dangers that lie both within and beyond their cave systems."

    descrition=_"The creatures collectively known as the “earth monsters” are diverse in appearance and behavior, yet all share an origin deep within the ancient caves that form their natural habitat. These monsters range from fierce, berserk fighters to agile swimmers, and each has evolved specific adaptations that suit the dark, treacherous world beneath the earth’s surface. Generally, earth monsters have hardened bodies, unique natural defenses, and a heightened sensitivity to the subtle changes in their environment. From predatory Krutilarys to swift, evasive Onoloms, these creatures exist within a delicate ecosystem shaped by survival and predation.

Most earth monsters are solitary by nature, defending their territories fiercely. However, some younger creatures, such as the Krutilarys Whelps and Onolom Hatchlings, may live in loose packs, relying on numbers for protection before they grow strong enough to survive independently. Earth monsters generally survive by preying on smaller cave creatures, and a few even scavenge the organic remnants that occasionally drift down from the cave entrances. Their unique adaptations make them exceptionally resilient: the Onoloms, for example, are naturally adept swimmers capable of surviving sudden floods, while the Garavandions rely on brute strength and aggression to ward off any creature that threatens their hunting grounds.

Though fierce and often hostile to one another, many earth monsters have been captured and domesticated by the earthmen, who use their knowledge of these creatures’ behaviors and habits to turn them into allies. This relationship between earthmen and earth monsters is tenuous, as the monsters resist taming and often require careful handling. Nevertheless, once under control, earth monsters become valuable tools in the earthmen’s arsenal, augmenting their defense capabilities. For outsiders, the earth monsters represent the formidable, untamed force of the underground, a testament to nature’s power in the unseen depths of the world."
